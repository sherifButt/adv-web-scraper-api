# Challenge: Frames

This page provides links to examples of different frame types: Nested Frames and iFrames.

## Approach

The `config.json` for this challenge simply navigates to the main frames page:

1.  **`goto`**: Navigates to the `/frames` page.

Specific interactions with nested frames or iFrames (like the WYSIWYG editor example) are handled in separate, more detailed configurations (e.g., `nested_frames/config.json` and `iframe/config.json` - *to be created*). This config serves primarily as a landing page navigation example.

## Configuration (`config.json`)

(See the `config.json` file in this directory)

## Expected Outcome

The navigation flow should complete successfully, landing on the frames selection page.
