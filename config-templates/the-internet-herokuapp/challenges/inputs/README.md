# Challenge: Inputs

This challenge involves a page with an input field specifically designed for numeric input (`<input type="number">`).

## Approach

The `config.json` for this challenge performs the following:

1.  **`goto`**: Navigates to the `/inputs` page.
2.  **`input`**: Enters a numeric value ("12345") into the number input field.

## Configuration (`config.json`)

(See the `config.json` file in this directory)

## Expected Outcome

The navigation flow should complete successfully, demonstrating the ability to input data into a number field. No specific data is extracted or asserted in this basic example.
