# Project Brief: Advanced Web Scraper API

## Overview
The Advanced Web Scraper API (adv-web-scraper-api) is a robust and flexible API designed to extract data from websites efficiently and reliably. This API aims to provide developers with a powerful tool for web scraping tasks, handling complex scenarios such as JavaScript rendering, authentication, and rate limiting.

## Core Requirements

1. **Flexible Data Extraction**
   - Support for various data formats (HTML, JSON, XML)
   - Ability to extract structured data from complex web pages
   - Support for CSS selectors, XPath, and custom extraction logic

2. **Scalability and Performance**
   - Handle high-volume scraping tasks efficiently
   - Distribute workload across multiple workers/threads
   - Optimize resource usage for large-scale operations

3. **Reliability and Robustness**
   - Handle network errors gracefully
   - Implement retry mechanisms for failed requests
   - Support for proxy rotation to avoid IP blocking

4. **Advanced Features**
   - JavaScript rendering support for dynamic websites
   - Authentication handling for protected content
   - Session management and cookie handling
   - Rate limiting and request throttling
   - CAPTCHA solving integration

5. **Developer Experience**
   - Clean, intuitive API design
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Easy integration with other systems
   - Flexible configuration options

6. **Compliance and Ethics**
   - Respect robots.txt directives
   - Implement rate limiting to avoid server overload
   - Provide tools for ethical scraping practices

## Project Goals

1. Create a versatile web scraping solution that can handle a wide range of websites and use cases
2. Provide superior performance compared to existing scraping libraries
3. Offer a developer-friendly API that simplifies complex scraping tasks
4. Ensure reliability and stability for production use cases
5. Support ethical scraping practices and compliance with website terms of service

## Success Criteria

1. Successfully extract data from a diverse set of websites, including those with dynamic content
2. Handle high-volume scraping tasks with optimal resource utilization
3. Provide comprehensive documentation and examples for common use cases
4. Achieve high reliability with proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
5. Receive positive feedback from early adopters and testers
