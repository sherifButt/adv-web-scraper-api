# Active Context: Advanced Web Scraper API

## Current Work Focus

### Rightmove Selector Implementation
- Implemented resilient selector patterns for Rightmove property scraping:
  - Wildcard class matching: [class*="partial-name"]
  - Data attribute selectors: [data-test^='propertyCard-']
  - Content-based selectors: :contains('Market')
  - Structural relationships: div:has(>span:contains('£'))
  - Multiple fallback strategies for each field
- These patterns handle dynamic class names while maintaining accuracy

## Current Blockers

Current implementation challenges include:

   - Type compatibility between navigation and extraction results

2. **CAPTCHA Solving Completion**
   - External service integration needs to be completed
   - Audio CAPTCHA solving requires additional implementation
   - Token harvesting needs a more sophisticated approach

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Test framework is set up but no tests have been written
   - Need to implement unit tests for core components
   - Integration tests for API endpoints needed

4. **ESLint Configuration**
   - Current ESLint rules are generating many formatting warnings
   - Need to adjust rules to better match the project's coding style
