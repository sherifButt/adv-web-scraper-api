# Active Context: Advanced Web Scraper API

## Current Work Focus

### Session Management Implementation
- Implemented comprehensive session management and cookie handling:
  - Persistent storage of browser sessions for reuse
  - Automatic CAPTCHA bypass for previously solved domains
  - Cookie and localStorage preservation between sessions
  - Session expiration and cleanup mechanisms
  - API endpoints for session management
- This implementation significantly reduces CAPTCHA solving needs when scraping the same website multiple times

### Rightmove Selector Implementation
- Implemented resilient selector patterns for Rightmove property scraping:
  - Wildcard class matching: [class*="partial-name"]
  - Data attribute selectors: [data-test^='propertyCard-']
  - Content-based selectors: :contains('Market')
  - Structural relationships: div:has(>span:contains('Â£'))
  - Multiple fallback strategies for each field
- These patterns handle dynamic class names while maintaining accuracy

The project is currently in the **initial implementation phase**. We have successfully set up the project structure and implemented the core components of the Advanced Web Scraper API. The primary focus areas are:

1. **Core Component Refinement**
   - Refining the browser automation module
   - Enhancing the human behavior emulation system
   - Improving CAPTCHA detection and solving capabilities
   - Optimizing proxy management and rotation

2. **Data Extraction Development**
   - Implementing the data extraction engine
   - Creating schema-based validation for extracted data
   - Building transformation pipelines for data cleaning
   - Developing storage adapters for different destinations

3. **API Enhancement**
   - Completing the REST API implementation
   - Adding request validation with JSON schema
   - Implementing response formatting and pagination
   - Adding comprehensive error handling and reporting

## Recent Changes

The project has progressed from planning to implementation. Recent activities include:

1. **Proxy System Enhancement**

   - Added detailed logging to `navigation-worker.ts` and `job.routes.ts` to debug result storage/retrieval issues.
   - Modified `navigation-worker.ts` to explicitly return results.
   - Adjusted `QueueService` to handle worker functions returning values.

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps for the project are:

1.  **Verify Job Result Retrieval**:
    *   Analyze logs generated after recent changes to confirm if results are being generated, stored, and retrieved correctly.
    *   Address any remaining issues identified in the logs (e.g., storage failures, incorrect data format).

2.  **Worker Implementation (Scraping)**:
    *   Implement the worker process for handling scraping jobs queued via `/api/v1/scrape`.
    *   Ensure scraping results are stored and retrieved similarly to navigation jobs.

3.  **API Completion**:
    *   Add request validation (e.g., using Zod).
    *   Implement consistent response formatting and pagination.
    *   Add rate limiting.

4.  **Testing and Validation**:
    *   Implement unit tests for `QueueService`, `StorageService`, and worker functions.
    *   Create integration tests for job submission (`/navigate`, `/scrape`) and status retrieval (`/jobs/:id`).
    *   Develop end-to-end tests for representative scraping scenarios.

5.  **Documentation**:
    *   Update `docs/api/queue-system.md` with final details on job status response and result retrieval.
    *   Update `techContext.md` with worker implementation details.
    *   Ensure `docs/README.md` is up-to-date.

## Open Questions

As implementation progresses, several questions need to be addressed:

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - How can we further optimize browser resource usage?
   - What caching strategies should be implemented for repeated requests?
   - How can we improve the efficiency of human emulation without sacrificing realism?

2. **CAPTCHA Solving Enhancement**
   - What is the most effective approach for audio CAPTCHA solving?
   - How can we improve token harvesting for reCAPTCHA?
   - What fallback mechanisms should be implemented for solving failures?

3. **Data Extraction Design**
   - â What is the optimal balance between flexibility and ease of use for the extraction API?
     - *Answer: A declarative configuration approach with strong typing provides both flexibility and ease of use*
   - â How should we handle different data formats and structures?
     - *Answer: Support for CSS, XPath, regex, and custom functions covers most use cases*
   - â What validation mechanisms are most appropriate for extracted data?
     - *Answer: Schema-based validation with data type conversion and transformation functions*
   - â What storage adapters should be implemented first?
     - *Answer: Memory, File, MongoDB, Redis, and API endpoint adapters provide a comprehensive solution.*
   - How should we handle pagination for large datasets in storage listing? (Future consideration)

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - What is the most effective approach for testing browser automation? (Needs definition)
   - How can we simulate various CAPTCHA scenarios for testing? (Needs definition)
   - What metrics should we use to evaluate human emulation effectiveness? (Needs definition)

5. **Job Result Handling**
   - **Decision**: Retrieve results first from `StorageService`, fallback to `job.returnvalue`.
   - **Status**: Implemented in `/api/v1/jobs/:id`. Logging added to verify flow. Worker now explicitly returns results.
   - **Refinement Needed**: Confirm reliability based on log analysis. Decide on error handling if both methods fail.

## Current Blockers

Current implementation challenges include:

1.  **Job Result Reliability**: Need to confirm via logs that results are consistently generated, stored, and retrieved. The `result: null` issue reported by the user needs root cause analysis based on new logs.
2.  **Testing Infrastructure**: Lack of tests makes verifying changes difficult and regression-prone. Unit and integration tests are needed urgently.
3.  **Scraping Worker**: The worker for handling `/api/v1/scrape` jobs is not yet implemented.
4.  **CAPTCHA Solving Completion**: External service integration and advanced techniques are pending.
5.  **ESLint/TypeScript Issues**: Minor formatting and type issues still need cleanup.
