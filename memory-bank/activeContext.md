# Active Context: Advanced Web Scraper API

## Current Work Focus

### Session Management Implementation
- Implemented comprehensive session management and cookie handling:
  - Persistent storage of browser sessions for reuse
  - Automatic CAPTCHA bypass for previously solved domains
  - Cookie and localStorage preservation between sessions
  - Session expiration and cleanup mechanisms
  - API endpoints for session management
- This implementation significantly reduces CAPTCHA solving needs when scraping the same website multiple times

### Rightmove Selector Implementation
- Implemented resilient selector patterns for Rightmove property scraping:
  - Wildcard class matching: [class*="partial-name"]
  - Data attribute selectors: [data-test^='propertyCard-']
  - Content-based selectors: :contains('Market')
  - Structural relationships: div:has(>span:contains('Â£'))
  - Multiple fallback strategies for each field
- These patterns handle dynamic class names while maintaining accuracy

The project is currently in the **initial implementation phase**. We have successfully set up the project structure and implemented the core components of the Advanced Web Scraper API. The primary focus areas are:

1. **Core Component Refinement**
   - Refining the browser automation module
   - Enhancing the human behavior emulation system
   - Improving CAPTCHA detection and solving capabilities
   - Optimizing proxy management and rotation

2. **Data Extraction Development**
   - Implementing the data extraction engine
   - Creating schema-based validation for extracted data
   - Building transformation pipelines for data cleaning
   - Developing storage adapters for different destinations

3. **API Enhancement**
   - Completing the REST API implementation
   - Adding request validation with JSON schema
   - Implementing response formatting and pagination
   - Adding comprehensive error handling and reporting

## Recent Changes

The project has progressed from planning to implementation. Recent activities include:

1. **Proxy System Enhancement**
   - **Switched proxy source from `proxies.txt` to `proxies.json`**: Allows for richer proxy metadata.
   - **Updated `ProxyInfo` type**: Aligned type definition (`src/types/index.ts`) with the structure of `proxies.json`.
   - **Refactored `ProxyManager` (`src/core/proxy/proxy-manager.ts`)**:
     - Modified `loadProxiesFromJsonFile` to parse the new JSON format.
     - Updated internal logic to use `ip` instead of `host` and `protocols` array instead of `type`.
     - Enhanced filtering in `listProxies` and `getProxy` to use new metadata fields.
     - Improved sorting logic in `getProxy` using latency and uptime from JSON.
     - Updated `getProxyStats` to provide more detailed statistics based on JSON data.
     - Refined health checking (`checkProxyHealth`, `checkSingleProxy`).
     - Updated `testProxy`, `rotateProxy`, `validateAllProxies`, `cleanProxyList` to align with new structure.
   - **Updated API Endpoints (`src/api/routes/proxy.routes.ts`)**:
     - Enhanced `/list` endpoint with more filtering options based on JSON fields.
     - Updated `/stats` endpoint to return richer statistics.
     - Modified `/rotate` endpoint to accept more detailed criteria and return richer proxy info.
     - Updated `/clean` endpoint response structure.
   - **Updated Configuration (`src/config/index.ts`)**: Pointed file source to `proxies.json`.
   - **Fixed related errors** in `navigation.routes.ts`.

2. **Project Structure Implementation**
   - Set up TypeScript project with ESM modules

   - Implemented type definitions for core components

3. **Core Component Implementation**
   - Implemented browser automation module with Playwright
   - Created human behavior emulation with realistic patterns
   - Developed CAPTCHA detection for multiple CAPTCHA types
   - Built proxy management system with rotation and health checking
   - Implemented initial navigation engine for multi-step flows
   - **Refactored Navigation Engine:** Migrated step execution logic into individual handler classes (Strategy pattern) managed by a `StepHandlerFactory`. This improves modularity and extensibility.

4. **API Implementation**
   - Set up Express.js server with middleware
   - Created API routes for core functionality
   - Implemented navigation routes connected to the navigation engine
   - Implemented error handling middleware
   - Added logging infrastructure

   - Added detailed logging to `navigation-worker.ts` and `job.routes.ts` to debug result storage/retrieval issues.
   - Modified `navigation-worker.ts` to explicitly return results.
   - Adjusted `QueueService` to handle worker functions returning values.
   - **Fixed Proxy Integration in Worker**: Updated `navigation-worker.ts` to correctly fetch a proxy from `ProxyManager` (if enabled) and pass it to `BrowserPool` when requesting a browser instance. This ensures navigation jobs use the configured proxies.

5. **AI Configuration Generation (Refactored & Enhanced)**
   - Created types for AI generation requests, options, status, and results (`src/types/ai-generation.types.ts`).
   - Added AI configuration section to main config (`src/config/index.ts`).
   - **Refactored `AiService` (`src/core/ai/ai-service.ts`)**:
     - Separated concerns into distinct modules.
     - Extracted prompt templates (including few-shot examples) into `src/core/ai/prompt-templates/`.
     - Created `AdapterFactory` (`src/core/ai/factories/`) for LLM adapter instantiation.
     - Moved model configuration (costs, provider mapping) to `src/core/ai/config/model-config.ts`.
     - Created `CostCalculator` service (`src/core/ai/services/`) for cost estimation.
     - Removed unused few-shot example constants from `AiService`.
   - **Added Cost Tracking**:
     - Updated `generate-config-worker.ts` to accumulate AI costs and store the final `estimatedCost` with the result.
     - Updated `job.routes.ts` (`GET /api/v1/jobs/:id`) to retrieve and return the `estimatedCost` for completed jobs.
   - **Added Model Cost Placeholder**: Added placeholder costs for `gpt-4.1-mini` in `model-config.ts` to prevent calculation warnings.
   - Implemented `generate-config-worker.ts` (`src/core/queue/`) to handle asynchronous job processing, including the generate-validate-test-fix loop and status updates.
   - Integrated the `config-generation-jobs` queue and worker into `QueueService` (`src/core/queue/queue-service.ts`).
   - Created the `POST /api/v1/ai/generate-config` endpoint (`src/api/routes/ai.routes.ts`).
   - Mounted the AI routes in the main API router (`src/api/routes/index.ts`).

   - Separating AI concerns (prompts, adapter logic, cost calculation, configuration) into distinct modules improves maintainability.
   - Tracking AI costs per job provides valuable operational insight.

## Open Questions

As implementation progresses, several questions need to be addressed:

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - How can we further optimize browser resource usage?
   - What caching strategies should be implemented for repeated requests?
   - How can we improve the efficiency of human emulation without sacrificing realism?

2. **CAPTCHA Solving Enhancement**
   - What is the most effective approach for audio CAPTCHA solving?
   - How can we improve token harvesting for reCAPTCHA?
   - What fallback mechanisms should be implemented for solving failures?

3. **Data Extraction Design**
   - â What is the optimal balance between flexibility and ease of use for the extraction API?
     - *Answer: A declarative configuration approach with strong typing provides both flexibility and ease of use*
   - â How should we handle different data formats and structures?
     - *Answer: Support for CSS, XPath, regex, and custom functions covers most use cases*
   - â What validation mechanisms are most appropriate for extracted data?
     - *Answer: Schema-based validation with data type conversion and transformation functions*
   - â What storage adapters should be implemented first?
     - *Answer: Memory, File, MongoDB, Redis, and API endpoint adapters provide a comprehensive solution.*
   - How should we handle pagination for large datasets in storage listing? (Future consideration)

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - What is the most effective approach for testing browser automation? (Needs definition)
   - How can we simulate various CAPTCHA scenarios for testing? (Needs definition)
   - What metrics should we use to evaluate human emulation effectiveness? (Needs definition)
   - How can the AI-generated config testing be made more robust (beyond basic error/data checks)?

5. **Job Result Handling**
   - **Decision**: Retrieve results first from `StorageService`, fallback to `job.returnvalue`.
   - **Status**: Implemented in `/api/v1/jobs/:id`. Logging added to verify flow. Worker now explicitly returns results.
   - **Refinement Needed**: Confirm reliability based on log analysis. Decide on error handling if both methods fail.

6. **AI Generation Refinement**
    - Which LLM provides the best balance of cost and accuracy for config generation? (Ongoing evaluation)
    - How can prompt engineering be improved to handle more complex scraping scenarios? (Needs further refinement)
    - What are the best strategies for evaluating the success of an AI-generated test run? (Needs definition beyond basic checks)
    - When should the placeholder costs for `gpt-4.1-mini` be updated? (Requires monitoring OpenAI pricing)

## Current Blockers

Current implementation challenges include:

1.  **Job Result Reliability**: Need to confirm via logs that results are consistently generated, stored, and retrieved. The `result: null` issue reported by the user needs root cause analysis based on new logs.
2.  **Testing Infrastructure**: Lack of tests makes verifying changes difficult and regression-prone. Unit and integration tests are needed urgently.
3.  **Scraping Worker**: The worker for handling `/api/v1/scrape` jobs is not yet implemented.
4.  **CAPTCHA Solving Completion**: External service integration and advanced techniques are pending.
5.  **AI Service Implementation**: Placeholder logic in LLM adapters needs replacement with actual LLM API calls.
6.  **ESLint/TypeScript Issues**: Minor formatting and type issues still need cleanup (some persistent issues in worker and route files).

*Note: This document will be regularly updated as implementation progresses and new insights emerge.*
