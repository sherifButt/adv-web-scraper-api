# Project Progress: Advanced Web Scraper API

## Current Status

**Project Phase**: Worker Implementation & Debugging
**Overall Progress**: 65%
**Current Focus**: Ensuring Job Result Retrieval & Storage
**Last Updated**: April 12, 2025

## What Works

### Proxy System
- **Proxy source switched to `proxies.json`**: Utilizes rich metadata.
- **`ProxyManager` refactored**: Handles JSON format, uses detailed proxy info (protocols, latency, uptime) for filtering and sorting.
- **Enhanced API endpoints (`/api/v1/proxy/*`)**: Leverages new metadata for filtering, stats, rotation, and testing.
- Internal success rate and response time tracking implemented.
- Health checking and proxy rotation logic updated.
- Configuration points to `proxies.json`.

### Queue System
- Redis-based queue infrastructure using BullMQ
- Job queuing for both scraping and navigation endpoints (`/api/v1/scrape`, `/api/v1/navigate`)
- Job status tracking and monitoring via `/api/v1/jobs/:id`
- Automatic retry mechanisms for failed jobs
- Priority queue support for critical tasks
- Job progress tracking and status updates

### Worker Processes (Partial)
- Navigation worker (`navigation-worker.ts`) processes jobs from the `navigation-jobs` queue.
- **Navigation worker now correctly fetches and applies proxies** from `ProxyManager` when enabled.
- Worker attempts to store results using `StorageService`.
- Worker returns results upon completion, allowing fallback retrieval via `job.returnvalue`.
- Added detailed logging for result generation, storage attempts, and retrieval attempts.

### API Endpoints
- `/api/v1/scrape` queues scraping jobs.
- `/api/v1/navigate` queues navigation jobs.
- `/api/v1/jobs` lists all jobs across queues.
- `/api/v1/jobs/:id` retrieves job status and attempts to retrieve results (from storage or `job.returnvalue`).
- `/api/v1/jobs/:id` (DELETE) cancels a job.
- `/api/v1/ai/generate-config` queues AI config generation jobs.

### AI Configuration Generation
- Backend foundation implemented (types, worker, queue, API endpoint).
- **`AiService` refactored** into modular components (prompts, factory, config, calculator).
- Prompt templates extracted and include few-shot examples.
- Worker includes generate-validate-test-fix loop logic.
- Basic Zod schema validation for generated config.
- Job status updates track generation/testing/fixing stages.
- **Cost tracking implemented**: Worker accumulates cost, stores it with the result, and the job status API returns it.
- Placeholder costs added for `gpt-4.1-mini`.
   - **Interaction Hints**: Added optional `interactionHints` to API request and integrated into worker, service, and prompt generation to guide AI for dynamic content.

### Configuration Templates
- **Restructured `the-internet-herokuapp`**: Migrated examples into a new `challenges/` subdirectory structure.
  - Each challenge (`ab_testing`, `add_remove_elements`, `basic_auth`, etc.) has its own folder containing:
    - `README.md` with YAML front matter metadata (title, path, description, tags, difficulty, related_steps).
    - `config.json` focused on the specific challenge.
  - Updated the parent `README.md` to explain the new structure.
  - **Next:** Complete creating folders/files for remaining challenges, populate index in parent README, remove old monolithic files.

## What's Left to Build

1. **Template Restructuring (`the-internet-herokuapp`)**
   - Finish creating individual folders, READMEs, and `config.json` files for all remaining challenges.
   - Populate the Challenge Index in `config-templates/the-internet-herokuapp/README.md`.
   - Remove old monolithic config files (`the-internet-herokuapp-config.json`, `the-internet-herokuapp-full-config.json`, etc.).

2. **Worker Processes (Completion)**
   - Implement worker process for scraping jobs.
   - Verify storage mechanism is working reliably (pending log review).
   - Refine error handling within workers.

2. **AI Feature Completion**
   - Implement actual LLM API calls in adapters (replace placeholder logic).
   - Refine prompt engineering (including use of `interactionHints`) for better configuration generation and fixing.
   - Refine the testing logic and success criteria within `generate-config-worker.ts`.
   - Add more robust schema validation (Zod) for generated configurations.
   - Update placeholder costs for `gpt-4.1-mini` when available.

3. **Monitoring & Management**
   - Implement a dashboard or CLI tools for queue monitoring.
   - Add functionality for job prioritization adjustments.
   - Collect and expose performance metrics (job duration, failure rates).

3. **API Completion**
   - Add request validation (e.g., using Zod or Joi).
   - Implement response formatting consistency and pagination where needed.
   - Add rate limiting.
   - Consider webhook notifications for job completion/failure.

4. **Testing**
   - Implement unit tests for core services (QueueService, StorageService, AiService, workers).
   - Create integration tests for API endpoints, including AI generation and job status retrieval.
   - Develop end-to-end tests for common navigation/scraping flows and AI generation scenarios.

## Updated Implementation Plan

### Phase 7: Optimization & Scaling (In Progress)
- [x] Queue system foundation (BullMQ, Redis)
- [x] Basic worker process implementation (`navigation-worker.ts`)
- [x] Result storage logic (initial implementation, needs verification)

- [ ] Worker process for scraping jobs
- [ ] Verify and refine result storage/retrieval reliability
- [ ] Performance optimization (concurrency, resource limits)
- [ ] Monitoring implementation

### Phase 8: AI Integration & Refinement (In Progress)
- [x] AI config generation backend foundation (API, Queue, Worker)
- [x] Refactor `AiService` into modular components.
- [x] Implement AI cost tracking and API exposure.
