# Project Progress: Advanced Web Scraper API

## Current Status

**Project Phase**: Worker Implementation & Debugging
**Overall Progress**: 65%
**Current Focus**: Ensuring Job Result Retrieval & Storage
**Last Updated**: April 12, 2025

## What Works

### Proxy System
- **Proxy source switched to `proxies.json`**: Utilizes rich metadata.
- **`ProxyManager` refactored**: Handles JSON format, uses detailed proxy info (protocols, latency, uptime) for filtering and sorting.
- **Enhanced API endpoints (`/api/v1/proxy/*`)**: Leverages new metadata for filtering, stats, rotation, and testing.
- Internal success rate and response time tracking implemented.
- Health checking and proxy rotation logic updated.
- Configuration points to `proxies.json`.

### Queue System
- Redis-based queue infrastructure using BullMQ
- Job queuing for both scraping and navigation endpoints (`/api/v1/scrape`, `/api/v1/navigate`)
- Job status tracking and monitoring via `/api/v1/jobs/:id`
- Automatic retry mechanisms for failed jobs
- Priority queue support for critical tasks
- Job progress tracking and status updates

### Worker Processes (Partial)
- Navigation worker (`navigation-worker.ts`) processes jobs from the `navigation-jobs` queue.
- **Navigation worker now correctly fetches and applies proxies** from `ProxyManager` when enabled.
- Worker attempts to store results using `StorageService`.
- Worker returns results upon completion, allowing fallback retrieval via `job.returnvalue`.
- Added detailed logging for result generation, storage attempts, and retrieval attempts.

### API Endpoints
- `/api/v1/scrape` queues scraping jobs.
- `/api/v1/navigate` queues navigation jobs.
- `/api/v1/jobs` lists all jobs across queues.
- `/api/v1/jobs/:id` retrieves job status and attempts to retrieve results (from storage or `job.returnvalue`).
- `/api/v1/jobs/:id` (DELETE) cancels a job.
- `/api/v1/ai/generate-config` queues AI config generation jobs.

### AI Configuration Generation
- Backend foundation implemented (types, service placeholder, worker, queue, API endpoint).
- Worker includes generate-validate-test-fix loop logic.
- Basic Zod schema validation for generated config.
- Job status updates track generation/testing/fixing stages.
- Cost estimation based on token usage.

## What's Left to Build

1. **Worker Processes (Completion)**
   - Implement worker process for scraping jobs.
   - Verify storage mechanism is working reliably (pending log review).
   - Refine error handling within workers.

2. **AI Feature Completion**
   - Implemented LLM API calls in `AiService` for OpenAI and DeepSeek models
   - Standardized model naming (gpt-4-mini, deepseek-reasoning)
   - Simplified configuration to just OPENAI_API_KEY and DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
   - Removed deprecated GPT4Mini and DeepSeek R1 adapters
   - Enhanced cost calculation for all supported models
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing functionality

3. **Monitoring & Management**
   - Implement a dashboard or CLI tools for queue monitoring.
   - Add functionality for job prioritization adjustments.
   - Collect and expose performance metrics (job duration, failure rates).

3. **API Completion**
   - Add request validation (e.g., using Zod or Joi).
   - Implement response formatting consistency and pagination where needed.
   - Add rate limiting.
   - Consider webhook notifications for job completion/failure.

4. **Testing**
   - Implement unit tests for core services (QueueService, StorageService, AiService, workers).
   - Create integration tests for API endpoints, including AI generation and job status retrieval.
   - Develop end-to-end tests for common navigation/scraping flows and AI generation scenarios.

## Updated Implementation Plan

### Phase 7: Optimization & Scaling (In Progress)
- [x] Queue system foundation (BullMQ, Redis)
- [x] Basic worker process implementation (`navigation-worker.ts`)
- [x] Result storage logic (initial implementation, needs verification)
- [x] Job status API (`/api/v1/jobs/:id`) with result retrieval logic
- [ ] Worker process for scraping jobs
- [ ] Verify and refine result storage/retrieval reliability
- [ ] Performance optimization (concurrency, resource limits)
- [ ] Monitoring implementation

### Phase 8: AI Integration & Refinement (Next)
- [x] AI config generation backend foundation (API, Queue, Worker, Service Placeholder)
- [ ] Implement actual LLM API calls in `AiService`.
- [ ] Refine AI prompts and test/fix loop in `generate-config-worker`.
- [ ] Add detailed Zod schema validation for AI output.
- [ ] Implement unit and integration tests for AI feature.
- [ ] Document AI feature (`docs/ai/README.md`, update main README/API docs).

## Documentation Updates Needed
- [x] Add queue system architecture to `systemPatterns.md` (Done previously)
- [x] Update API documentation (`docs/api/queue-system.md`) for job status response fields and result retrieval logic.
- [x] Update worker implementation details in `techContext.md` (Added AI worker details).
- [ ] Update `docs/README.md` Table of Contents (Add AI section).
- [ ] Create `docs/ai/README.md` (or similar) for AI feature documentation.
- [ ] Update `docs/api/README.md` (or create `docs/api/ai-api.md`) with AI endpoint details.
