# Project Progress: Advanced Web Scraper API

## Current Status

**Project Phase**: Initial Implementation

**Overall Progress**: 40%

**Current Sprint Focus**: Core component implementation

**Last Updated**: May 4, 2025 (Updated with Data Extraction Engine implementation)

## What Works

The project has progressed from planning to initial implementation. We now have the following in place:

1. **Project Structure**
   - Complete TypeScript project setup with ESM modules
   - Development environment configuration (ESLint, Prettier)
   - Directory structure following the planned architecture
   - Type definitions for core components

2. **Core Components**
   - Browser automation module with Playwright integration
   - Human behavior emulation with realistic mouse and keyboard patterns
   - CAPTCHA detection for multiple CAPTCHA types
   - CAPTCHA solving framework with multiple strategies
   - Proxy management system with rotation and health checking
   - **Navigation engine:** Refactored to use a handler-based system (Strategy/Factory pattern) for improved modularity and extensibility. Core logic for flow control, session handling, CAPTCHA checks, and screenshots remains in the engine.

3. **API Foundation**
   - Express.js server setup
   - API routes for scraping, CAPTCHA solving, proxy management, and navigation
   - Error handling middleware
   - Configuration management
   - Logging infrastructure

## Known Issues

As implementation has begun, we've encountered and addressed several challenges:

1. **CAPTCHA Solving Implementation**
   - Current implementation provides the framework but needs more robust solving strategies
   - External service integration needs to be completed with actual API calls
   - Audio CAPTCHA solving requires additional speech-to-text integration
   - Token harvesting needs a more sophisticated approach
   - Session management and cookie handling now implemented to reduce CAPTCHA solving needs

2. **TypeScript Integration**
   - Some TypeScript errors remain in the codebase that need to be addressed
   - Type definitions for complex objects need refinement
   - Better typing for Playwright interactions needed

3. **ESLint Configuration**
   - Current ESLint rules are generating many formatting warnings
   - Need to adjust rules to better match the project's coding style
   - Consider adding more specific rules for the project's needs

4. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Test framework is set up but no tests have been written yet
   - Need to implement unit tests for core components
   - Integration tests for API endpoints needed

## Evolution of Project Decisions

Key decisions have evolved as implementation has progressed:

## Lessons Learned

As implementation has progressed, we've gained several insights:

1. **TypeScript Integration**
   - TypeScript provides excellent type safety but requires careful interface design
   - Generic types are essential for flexible component interactions
   - Type definitions should be centralized for consistency

2. **Browser Automation**
   - Playwright offers superior capabilities compared to Puppeteer
   - Browser resource management is critical for stability
   - Human-like behavior requires sophisticated algorithms but pays off in detection avoidance

3. **Architecture Decisions**
   - The modular monolith approach has proven effective for development
   - Clear interfaces between components facilitate independent development
   - Strategy pattern is valuable for components with multiple implementation options

4. **Development Workflow**
   - ESLint and Prettier integration improves code quality
   - Comprehensive logging is essential for debugging complex interactions
   - Environment-based configuration simplifies development and testing

## Next Immediate Actions

1. Enhance CAPTCHA solving strategies with actual external service integration
2. Implement unit tests for core components
3. Add request validation with JSON schema
4. Refine TypeScript types to resolve remaining errors
5. Expand API documentation with more examples
6. Implement remaining API routes
7. Improve session management with more sophisticated storage options
